# Build_LAN-simple-
My first repository on GitHub, just for revision what I have learnt

I'm a student, and I am new to GitHub, I am using GitHub hope that it could help me learn more.
The following building local area network is just follow what's in my memory, maybe there is something wrong.
I use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate building a LAN.
