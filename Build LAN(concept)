First of all, we need a router, and a PC0.
We use the serial cable connect PC0 port(RS 232) and router port(console) in order to configure router from PC0.

Then we have 3 devices, PC1, PC2, PC3 and a switch0 we connect them together with "cooper straight-through".
Connection Port for PC1: PC1 FastEthernet0 port connect to switch0 FastEthernet0/1 port (PC1:Fa0 --> swtch:Fa0/1)
Connection Port for PC2: PC2 FastEthernet0 port connect to switch0 FastEthernet0/1 port (PC2:Fa0 --> swtch:Fa0/2)
Connection Port for PC3: PC3 FastEthernet0 port connect to switch0 FastEthernet0/1 port (PC3:Fa0 --> swtch:Fa0/3)

Connect switch0 to the router with cooper straight-through.
Connection Port for switch0 to router:switch0 Fa0/4 --> router Fa0/0

Now we can setup the DNS server in this LAN, we connect the server to the router with "cooper cross-over".
Connection Port for router and the server:router Fa0/1 --> server Fa0

Above are just only setup a LAN that has a server and end devices(example:PC1,PC2), they still haven't has their own IP address to work as a LAN.
We are going to setup the IP address for the end devices and the DNS server.
switch0 don't need an ip address.

*extra* /* sometimes we might type wrong command at the router CLI causing we have to wait for long time to continue our configuration, we can solve de problem by doing this:
after enter privilege mode, enter to config mode then type"no ip domain-lookup" */

Let's go to PC0, we open the Terminal then we can see the router CLI(a interface that we can configure the router).(not sure real situation is same or not)
type "en" or "enable" to enter privilege mode after enter privilege mode we will see '#' behind our hostname, then type "conf t" to enter config mode.
type "interface fa0/0" for go to port Fa0/0(connected with switch0) interface in order to setup gate way ip address. //Each connection to the router has a gate way ip address
type "ip address <gate way ip address> <subnet mask>" to setup the gate way and subnet mask ip address. //subnet mask ip is "255.255.255.0"
after that we have to type "no shut" or "no shutdown" to activate(apply the changes).
type "exit" to return to previous mode.
as the same step, we go to the fa0/1 port interface to setup the server gate way and subnet mask ip address. ALWAYS REMEMBER to type "no shut" to apply the changes.
all the configuration we did just now is not saved, it means that if we turn off and on the router, the configuratoin we did is gone so that
ALWAY REMEMBER that we havet to type "copy run start" to save our configuration so that after we turn off and on the router, the configuratoin will be saved.
go to the server --> Desktop then set the server ip address, subnet mask and gate way.

We can setup static ip for out PC1, PC2, PC3 by going to the PC's command prompt type "ipconfig <ip address> <subnet mask>"
or
We can setup DHCP service in Router, by doing this PCs will obtain their dunamic IP from router.
go to the config mode then type"ip dhcp pool ANYNAME", then "network 192.168.15.0 255.255.255.0", then "default-router <gate way ip address for LAN(which connected to switch)>"
then type "dns-server 192.168.10.1"
go to command prompt of all PC type"ipconfig /renew" to obtain the dynamic IP address from router.
REMEMBER to save the configuration with "copy run start".
